# Galactic Paint

Galactic Paint lets you paint pixels onto your Galatic Unicorn over WiFi, in realtime!

## Setting Up

You'll need `WIFI_CONFIG.py` from the `common` directory to be saved to your Pico W. Open up `WIFI_CONFIG.py` in Thonny to add your wifi details (and save it when you're done).

You will also have to install `micropython-phew` and `microdot` through Thonny's Tools -> Manage Packages.

Run the example through Thonny and it should get connected and give you a URL to visit. Open that URL in your browser and start painting!
