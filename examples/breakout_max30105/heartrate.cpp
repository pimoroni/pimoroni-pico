 Optical Heart Rate Detection (PBA Algorithm)

 Given a series of IR samples from the MAX30105 we discern when a heart beat is occurring
 Let's have a brief chat about what this code does. We're going to try to detect
 heart-rate optically. This is tricky and prone to give false readings. We really don't
 want to get anyone hurt so use this code only as an example of how to process optical
 data. Build fun stuff with our MAX30105 breakout board but don't use it for actual
 medical diagnosis.
 Excellent background on optical heart rate detection:

 This is an implementation of Maxim's PBA (Penpheral Beat Amplitude) algorithm. It's been 
 converted to work within the Arduino framework.
