# Example code for using the psram

note: The c++ allocation and new stuff should really be thowing exceptions, but this seems to be disabled by default for the pico builds.

`rp2_psram.cpp` and `rp2_psram.h` are from: https://github.com/pimoroni/micropython

`lwmem` from: https://github.com/MaJerle/lwmem and is a submodule so make sure you fetch that.
