# Pimoroni Pico Libraries and Examples

Welcome to the brave new world of Pico! This repository contains the C/C++ and MicroPython libraries for our range of Raspberry Pi Pico addons.

First of all you need to decide if your project is going to be done in MicroPython or using C/C++ with the Pico SDK. We have instructions for both here:

- **MicroPython**: The easiest way to get start, setup is a breeze! [Click here to view instructions for MicroPython](setting-up-micropython.md)
- **C/C++**: For more advanced users that want to unlease the full power of Pico! [Click here to view instructions for C/C++](setting-up-the-pico-sdk.md)

# Software support for our Pico range

It's very early days for Pico and we've been working our little socks off to get everything ready for launch.

Most of our Pico addons have support for both C/C++ and MicroPython but we're still catching up a little bit in places.

The table below shows the current state of compatibly and some notes to set expectations:

|Product|C/C++ Library|MicroPython Library|Notes
|---|---|---|---
|[Pico Explorer Base](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/pico-explorer-base)|Yes|Yes|
|[Pico RGB Keypad](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/pico-rgb-keypad-base)|Yes|Yes|
|[Pico Unicorn Pack](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/pico-unicorn-pack)|Yes|Known Bug|There is a known issue we're working on
|[Pico Audio Pack](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/pico-audio-pack)|Yes|No|Limited Support for MicroPython planned
|[Pico Scroll Pack](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/pico-scroll-pack)|Yes|Yes|
|[Pico Display Pack](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/pico-display-pack)|Yes|Yes|

We will keep this information updated as things develop.

**Note:** It's very early days for Raspberry Pi Pico and it's likely that our libraries will undergo quite a lot of changes over the next couple of weeks as we take in feedback and expand the functionality.
