# Pimoroni Pico Libraries and Examples <!-- omit in toc -->

Welcome to the brave new world of Pico!

This repository contains the C/C++ and MicroPython libraries for our range of RP2040-based boards, Raspberry Pi Pico addons & [supported Breakout Garden sensors](#breakouts).

# MicroPython

The easiest way to get started. If you're new to Pico, we recommend you read our [getting started with Pico](https://learn.pimoroni.com/article/getting-started-with-pico) tutorial.

:warning: All of our MicroPython libraries are baked into a batteries-included, custom version of MicroPython which you can grab from releases: [https://github.com/pimoroni/pimoroni-pico/releases/latest/](https://github.com/pimoroni/pimoroni-pico/releases/latest/)

New releases are issued regularly with new libraries, bug fixes to our existing libraries and new features inherited from MicroPython upstream. Be sure to check back!

## MicroPython Examples

You can find MicroPython examples for supported sensors, packs and bases in the "micropython/examples" directory:

* [MicroPython Examples](micropython/examples)

# C/C++

Advanced users that want to unleash the full power of Pico can use our C++ libraries. If you know what you're doing and want to build your own Pimoroni Pico project then start with the [Pimoroni Pico SDK Boilerplate](https://github.com/pimoroni/pico-boilerplate).

* [Readme: Instructions for setting up the C/C++ SDK](setting-up-the-pico-sdk.md)

## C++ Examples

You can find examples for supported sensors, packs and bases in the "examples" directory:

* [C++ Examples](examples)


## Boilerplate for C++ Projects

We also maintain a C++/CMake boilerplate with GitHub workflows configured for testing and a basic skeleton project.
